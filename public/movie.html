<h1>The Best Movies According to Aditya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zodiac</h3>
<p>It's one of the best movies of Jake Gyllenhaal. I love the overall running sequence of the movie.
    The gripping way it develops and its set environment.
</p>

<h3>Everyday </h3>
<p> I love how this movie is so unrealistic yet it's able to give a real world feel of why you need love
    and how it changes your life. It has a special place in my list.
</p>

<h3>Ghajini</h3>
<p>It has a great story and actors have performed perfectly.</p>
